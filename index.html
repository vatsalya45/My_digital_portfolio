        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
        <p>Hello! I'm Vatsalya Shukla, a passionate and aspiring web developer with a strong interest in creating modern and responsive web applications. My journey into web development began when I first encountered HTML and CSS in 2018.</p>
        
        <p>I pursued my studies in B.Tech. at RGPV Bhopal, where I've honed my skills in various web technologies, including JavaScript, React, and Node.js. In addition to my academic pursuits, I've completed several personal and collaborative projects. Beyond coding, I enjoy playing and watching cricket, watching movies and extra curricullam activities. </p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd like to connect or collaborate with me.</p>

                <h3>Soil Detection System</h3>
                <p>The Soil Detection System project analyzed soil quality using sensors and microcontrollers like Arduino to measure moisture, pH, and nutrients. It provided real-time monitoring, automated recommendations, and a user-friendly interface. Challenges like sensor calibration and data filtering were addressed to ensure accuracy. The system improved agricultural efficiency and crop yields, with future plans to integrate machine learning and IoT for enhanced functionality.</p>

                <h3>Smart Irrigation with Fertilizer Integration system</h3>
                <p>The Smart Irrigation with Fertilizer Integration system is an automated solution designed to optimize water and nutrient delivery in agricultural fields. It combines irrigation with precise fertilizer and pesticide application, controlled through a MATLAB-based program. The system enhances efficiency by adjusting resources based on real-time soil and environmental data, reducing waste and improving crop yields. This project was also published as a research paper in STM JOURNALS.</p>
